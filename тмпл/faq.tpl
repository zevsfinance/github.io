                        <p class="answer">Cryptocurrency mining is a process by which new coins are introduced into the existing circulating supply, as well as a process used to secure the network the coin operates on. The people who mine a coin, are known as miners. Thus, instead of having a central authority that controls and secures the money supply, this control and security is spread out across the network that miners help to maintain.</p>
